## What you're trying to do

<!-- The actual end goal. E.g. "I want my custom search engines synced
     across devices." -->

## What you've considered

<!-- Why doesn't the existing setup do this? What workarounds did you try? -->

## How it might fit

<!-- If you've thought about implementation: which Target module would
     this go into? Does it require new Helium-side reads/writes we don't
     already have? -->

## Scope check

Before submitting, please confirm this falls within the scope set in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#scope). The project deliberately
declines:

- Linux / macOS support (Windows-only fork; upstream [aadarwal/helium-sync](https://github.com/aadarwal/helium-sync) is macOS)
- Bidirectional *automatic* merge (manual conflict resolution available via `helium-sync resolve`)
- Browser-extension form factor
- History/cookies/passwords/extensions/settings sync

If your idea overlaps with one of those, the answer is probably "won't
do" — but please open the issue anyway if you think there's a way to
fit it into the existing scope.
